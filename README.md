# Invofy API

Simple API for creating invoices. Will be used together with one of my other projects, [Invofy SPA](https://github.com/ms223iu/Invofy-SPA). A lot of things still need to be implemented and/or fixed.

## Live Demo

Live demo can be found on [https://invofy.maciejsiwek.com](https://invofy.maciejsiwek.com). 

Feel free to log in with `demo` / `password` but please note that most of the functionality is not yet implemented on the client-side.

## Running on local machine

 1. Add the MongoDB connection string to `config.js`
 2. Run `npm install` & `npm run dev`
 3. Profit!
